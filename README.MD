# brain-validates

Dead simple validation for node and the browser.


## Concepts

When I am validating a value, whether it be from a form, from a POST, or anywhere else, I want to know the following:

* is the value valid?
* if not, what are the errors?

That's it.  I want it to be simple and give me a "yes" or "no, and here's why not" so I can move on to more interesting things.
